# LDPC_Codes_simulation
This is the LDPC decoding simulation project. All the codes are in C. I wrote them during a virtual research intern in National Tsing Hua University 2021. 
The three text files are 816/408, 8000/4000, 2640/1320 parity-check matrices respectively. 
Normally the setting is set to unitl "10000" error bits the prgramme terminates itself.
