# LDPC_Codes_simulation
This is the LDPC decoding simulation project. All the codes are in C. I wrote them during a virtual research intern in National Tsing Hua University 2021. 
The three text files are 816/408, 8000/4000, 2640/1320 parity-check matrices respectively. 
The whole simulation process is under binary symmetric channel with white Gaussian noises.
Normally the termination setting is set to "10000" error bits. 
Feel free to contact if you are interested in the project detail.
